What is Lorem Ipsum? Lorem Ipsu
m is simply dummy te xt of th
e printing and typeset ting i
ndustry. Lorem Ipsum has been 
the industry's standard dummy 
text ever since the 1500s, whe
n an unknown printer took a ga
lley of type and scrambl ed it
    to make a type
specimen book. It has survived
    not onl y five centuries, but
    also the leap into electron i
    typesetting, remaining essent
    ially unchanged. I t was pop
    ularised in the 1960s with t
    he release of L etraset shee
    s containing Lorem Ipsum pass
    ages,
and more recently with desktop
    publishing softw are like Ald
    us PageMaker including version
    s of Lorem Ipsum. Why do we us
    e it? It is a long established
    f act that a reader will be 
    distracted by the readabl e c
    ontent of a page when looking at
its layout. The point of using L
orem Ipsum is that it h as a mor
e-or-less normal distribution o
f letters, as opposed to using '
Content here, content here', mak
ing it look like readable Englis
h. Many desktop publishin g pack
ages and web page
editors now use Lorem Ipsum as t
heir default model text, and a s
earch for 'lorem ipsum' will unc
over many web sites still in the
ir infancy. Various versions hav
e evolved over the years, someti
mes by accident, someti mes on p
urpose (injected
humour and the like). But I must
    explain to you how all this mis
    taken idea of denouncing pleasu
    re and praising pain was born a
    nd I will give you a complete a
    ccount of the system, and expou
    nd the actual teachings of the 
    great explorer of the
truth, the master-builder of hum
n happiness. No one rejects, dis
likes, or avoids pleasure itself
, because it is pleasure, but be
cause those who do not know how 
to pursue pleasure rationally enc
ounter consequences that are ext
emely painful.
Nor again is there anyone who lo
ves or pursues or desires to obta
in pain of itself, because it is 
pain, but because occasionally ci
rcumstances occur in which toil 
and pain can procure him some gr
eat pleasure. To take a trivial e
xample, which
of us ever undertakes laborious p
hysical exercise, except to obtain
    some advantage from it? But who h
    as any right to find fault with a 
    man who chooses to enjoy a pleasur
    e that has no annoying consequence
    s, or one who avoids a pain that p
    roduces
no resultant pleasure?"
